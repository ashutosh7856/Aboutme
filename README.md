ABOUT ME
I have been deeply interested in technology from a young age, driven by a curiosity about how systems function and
how they can be enhanced. This passion prompted me to pursue a degree in Information Technology, where I have
established a solid foundation in programming, software development, and automation. I actively seek opportunities
to engage in hands-on projects that apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations. Collaborating with peers has
allowed me to refine my communication and problem-solving skills. I am now eager to further my studies in
Mechatronics and gain practical experience in this dynamic field. My goal is to contribute to innovative technological
solutions that address real-world challenges, particularly in automation and robotics.
